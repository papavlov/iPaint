# iPaint
C# project for drawing geometrical figures and doing different operations with them

The application is essentially a Windows forms app, where you can select to draw a new figure and do different manipulations with it or load a file with previously drawn figures.
The figures can be moved around the form on the screen, can be colored in a chosen color, can be deleted.
The application supports functionality to work with files as well - you can save the drawn figures to a new file, or open an already existing one.
